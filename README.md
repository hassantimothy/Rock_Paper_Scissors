# Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible shapes are:

Rock (a fist)
Paper (an open hand)
Scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V)
The rules are straightforward:

Rock crushes scissors (Rock wins)
Scissors cuts paper (Scissors wins)
Paper covers rock (Paper wins)
The game is often used as a decision-making tool between two individuals, where each player selects one of the three shapes, and the winner is determined based on the interactions between the shapes. It's a game of chance and strategy, as players attempt to anticipate and counter their opponent's choice to win each round.
